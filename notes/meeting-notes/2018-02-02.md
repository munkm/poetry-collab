### Group Meeting Feb 02, 2018

Attendees:
* Madicken
* Maxim

Notes:
* In the meeting today we are talking about Maxim's poetry parser. 
* There were a few errors. 
  * We worked through the debugging together. 
* A group git repo was set up. 
  * The history of the file parser is in the git history. 
  * Now all of our collaborators can see our workflow!
  * They can make our script better too. 

To use the script:

Execute `bash word-counter.sh FILENAME WORD` and replace FILENAME and WORD with
the poetry file and the word that you'd like to search for.
